Update 2014.05.04 - Google maps changed a few weeks ago. There's no "A" or "B", hence a new version of extension
as well. Option of filling starting point or destination is now in context menu.

JQuery and animated earth removed.

-------------------------
Extension uses the geolocation api to fill address field on Google Maps' Get directions.

Click on "A" - next to starting address to fill the input box with your coordinates, e.g. 35.123,-41.4892
Click on "B" - to set the destination address.

Works on: https://maps.google.com/
